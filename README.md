# Impact-of-Lifestyle-on-Depression-Level
This analysis presents insights based on a survey of 413,768 participants, which covers various socio-demographic, lifestyle, and health-related factors. The data provided sheds light on key attributes such as age, marital status, employment status, income levels, lifestyle choices (including sleep patterns, physical activity, alcohol consumption, dietary habits, and smoking), and their potential links to mental and physical health. The findings reveal notable trends regarding depression, physical health, and overall well-being among individuals across different age groups and demographics.

Key Insights
Socio-Demographics
1.	Participants by Age Range: The analysis of age distribution within the survey revealed a broad spectrum of participants, ranging from 18 years to over 70 years old, with the average age being 49 years. This suggests a well-represented demographic spanning both younger and older adults, providing a comprehensive understanding of various age-related factors in health and lifestyle.
2.	Marital Status: A significant proportion of participants are married, followed by those who are single, widowed, or divorced. Marital status has been linked to various mental health outcomes, particularly depression. Married individuals may face additional stressors such as financial struggles, particularly from family-related expenses, which can lead to mental exhaustion and, over time, contribute to depressive symptoms.
3.	Employment Status: Unemployment is a well-known risk factor for depression, as it can lead to financial instability, social isolation, and a sense of purposelessness. According to the survey, 265,659 participants are employed. However, the difference between those employed and unemployed is relatively small, suggesting that a significant number of people are still facing unemployment, which could contribute to increased depression rates and a lower quality of life.
4.	Average Income by Age Range: The survey reveals that individuals between the ages of 31-45 tend to have the highest average income compared to other age groups. This may be attributed to peak career years and increased financial stability. Conversely, participants aged 61 and older earn the least, which is expected as they approach retirement and typically rely on pension or fixed income sources. On average, participants across all age ranges earn $50.66k annually, indicating a moderate level of financial prosperity.

Lifestyle and Health
5.	Sleep Patterns: Sleep quality is crucial for overall health, and the survey findings indicate that a large number of participants report having "fair" sleep patterns, followed by a significant portion indicating "poor" sleep. A smaller group report "good" sleep quality. Sleep deprivation or poor sleep quality can negatively affect cognitive functions, mood, and mental health, and is strongly linked to depression. Improving sleep quality could be a key area for intervention in addressing mental health concerns.

6.	Physical Activity Level: Physical activity is well-documented as a critical factor in reducing the risk of depression. The survey results show that 42.74% of participants lead a sedentary lifestyle, while 38.19% engage in moderate physical activity. The relatively high percentage of sedentary individuals suggests that a considerable portion of the population may be at risk for physical and mental health problems, including depression, due to insufficient exercise.
7.	Alcohol Consumption: Alcohol consumption is often linked to both physical and mental health issues, including addiction and exacerbation of depressive symptoms. The survey shows that most participants consume alcohol in moderate quantities. While moderate alcohol consumption may not directly contribute to depression, it can still have negative effects on overall well-being and should be monitored.
   
8.	Dietary Habits: Unhealthy dietary habits are a significant concern, with 171,000 participants reporting poor eating habits. Diet plays a vital role in both physical and mental health, and unhealthy eating can contribute to obesity, chronic illness, and depression. However, the survey also indicates that 170,000 participants make an effort to improve their dietary habits, and 73,000 participants maintain healthy diets. These findings suggest that many people are striving to improve their lifestyle, which could positively impact their long-term health outcomes.
   
9.	Smoking Status: Smoking remains a major public health issue, as it is strongly linked to a wide range of chronic diseases and mental health disorders, including depression. The survey reveals that 247,000 participants are non-smokers, while 116,000 are former smokers. This indicates a positive trend towards reducing smoking habits, which is encouraging given the health risks associated with tobacco use.

Key Observations:
Age and Income Correlation: Participants between the ages of 31-45 show higher income levels, which could be attributed to peak career years. However, those over 61 experience lower income, which is expected due to retirement. A diverse range of income levels across age groups indicates a need for targeted financial support or programs, particularly for older adults.

Health and Lifestyle Risks: The high number of sedentary individuals, poor sleep patterns, and unhealthy dietary habits highlights areas where public health interventions could be most beneficial. Encouraging physical activity, improving sleep hygiene, and promoting healthier eating habits could mitigate mental and physical health risks.
Smoking and Alcohol Consumption: Although the survey shows a relatively high number of non-smokers and former smokers, alcohol consumption remains a concern, especially since it is often used to cope with depression.

Recommendations:
1.	Promote Mental Health Support Services: Given the potential link between marital status and depression, it is essential to provide accessible mental health support services for individuals facing financial or familial challenges. Counseling or support groups could help mitigate the mental health risks associated with marriage-related stress.
2.	Encourage Physical Activity and Healthy Habits: With a significant percentage of participants leading sedentary lifestyles, there is a clear need for public health campaigns promoting regular physical activity. Additionally, educational programs on the importance of sleep hygiene and healthy eating habits could be instrumental in improving overall well-being.
3.	Support for Unemployed Individuals: The relatively high unemployment rate among participants suggests a need for initiatives aimed at improving employment opportunities, especially for older adults. Job training programs and mental health support tailored for the unemployed could address both the economic and psychological challenges they face.
4.	Alcohol Awareness Campaigns: While many participants consume alcohol in moderation, it is essential to increase awareness of the long-term mental and physical health risks associated with alcohol consumption. Public health campaigns could emphasize healthier coping mechanisms for managing stress and mental health.
5.	Strengthen Anti-Smoking Initiatives: Encouraging non-smoking behaviors and supporting former smokers through cessation programs is vital for continuing the trend toward reduced smoking rates.
By focusing on these areas, it is possible to foster a healthier, more resilient population, reduce mental health issues like depression, and improve overall quality of life.
